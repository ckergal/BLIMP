### Data usage
In this `data` repository, you can find two subfolders, `coordinates` and `models`. 
In order to conduct use **BLIMP**, you only need prediciton models related files.

However, in `coordinates` folder you can find two `.tsv` files concerning data we used in our own studies.

- `orthologous_cancer_genes.tsv` describes 1317 orthologous genes between human and dog (D coordinates are for the Dog genome, 
H coordiantes for Human genome) known to be implied in various cancers.

- `cf4_transposable_elements.tsv` contains informations about transposable elements content of canine genes included in our orthologous panel.
