# Basenji Usage

Hear, we propose 4 steps describing how we managed the [Basenji](https://github.com/calico/basenji) tool suite to train and use a prediction model of canine gene expression.

The [first](https://github.com/ckergal/BLIMP/blob/main/tutorials/1_data_integration.md) provides help for data integration. [Then](https://github.com/ckergal/BLIMP/blob/main/tutorials/2_model_training.md), we explain how to train a prediction model and [finally](https://github.com/ckergal/BLIMP/blob/main/tutorials/3_model_test.md) how to assess it.


The last tutorial allows to use a prediction model in order to realize *in silico* saturated mutagenesis. This method can be performed on prediction models of canine gene expression we established and propose [here](https://github.com/ckergal/BLIMP/blob/main/import.ipynb), or on another prediciton model realized with steps below.
